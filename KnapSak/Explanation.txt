create table with extra row for items count (items count + 1) and extra col for capacities from 1 to maxCapacity (maxCapacity + 1)
start iterating items
for each item we can both take it (enough capacity) or not take it (not enough capacity)
get first item only and put it's value in the table when it fits as weight in current capacity
than take second item
if not enough capacity to take it -> get the value from above in the table (best for prev item)
if enough space to take it -> get max between value from above and value on table[row - 1, capacity - weight] + current item value
