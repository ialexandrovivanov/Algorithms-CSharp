CLASSICAL MAX FLOW PROBLEM
BIPARTITE GRAPH PROBLEM EXPLANATION
FIND THE MAXIMUM ASSIGNMENT THAT ASSIGNS TASKS TO PEOPLE TO COMPLETE A MAXIMUM NUMBER OF TASKS

Different final output results can be acheived using different technics(BFS DFS) of traversing all vertices but stil all are correct

1. Create 'BIPARTITE DIRECTED GRAPH' connecting people who are able to do certain tasks to these tasks using edges with value 1
2. Connect extra start vertex with all people with edges with value 1 and all tasks with extra vertex with edges with value 1
3. Create a matrix[(people + tasks + start + end), (people + tasks + start + end)] size
4. Find the first possible path from start vertex to end vertex and when found make value of all edges 0 so cut the possibillity
this task to be done again by other man. Assign the task to the first picked man. 
5. Reverse all edges from this path (if person A can do task 1 and the original edge is from A to 1 make it from 1 pointing to A) with value 1
(this gives us the possibillity to find out which task to which person is assigned at the end of algorithm)
6. Keep finding paths from step 3 until no more possibillities
7. Print result
